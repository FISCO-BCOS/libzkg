# libzkg

## v1.0.0

### Ideas

Libzkg is a zero-knowledge proof library based on FISCO-BCOS project.-  

- For users, they use libzkg to generate shield transactions, nobody else can know what's inside the transactions.
- For verifiers, they can verify every shield transactions generated by libzkg without knowing something of the transactions.
- For goverments, they can decode the shield transactions on blockchain and know what's happend.

### Design

Libzkg is deveped for supporting zero-knowldge proof senarios of FISCO-BCOS.

Every senario supported by libzkg is based on this 3 principle:

- User can generate a shield transaction according with the certain senario.
- Verifier can verify the shield transaction without knowing the information of the transaction.
- Goverment can decode every shield transaction on blockchain.

### Supporting Senarios

- tx1to1: Shield money transfer from one to one.
